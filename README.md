# rock-paper-scissor

I created this project to test my basic JavaScript skills.
I build a devtool console based rock-paper-scissor game.

Rock beats Scissor.
Scissor beats Paper.
Paper beats Rocks.

This game will be of five rounds.
You will be playing against a computer.

After each round, your's and computer's score get updated accordingly.

When, all rounds are over, both scores will be compared to determine who is the winner (or whether it's a draw).
